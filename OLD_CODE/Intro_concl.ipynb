    "In our project, we aimed to explore the factors influencing the perceptions of the Armenian population on four key topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether the dissolution of the Soviet Union was perceived as a good or bad thing.\n",
    "Who is perceived as the main enemy of Armenia.\n",
    "Who is perceived as the main friend of Armenia.\n",
    "Opinions regarding the European Union (EU).\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate these topics, we analyzed data from the 2019 Caucasus Barometer, which conducts annual surveys on social and political matters in Armenia and Georgia. We chose the 2019 data as it provides insights from a pivotal period: one year before the 2020 war with Azerbaijan and one year after the Armenian revolution. This context allows us to assess public sentiment during a time of significant change in Armenia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis focused on how various independent variables—such as respondents' age, income, education level, and political affiliation or sympathy towards liberal or conservative parties—influence these perceptions. For each of the four topics, we generated specific hypotheses that we aimed to test and potentially reject, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the social dynamics shaping public opinion in Armenia during this period."

    "The analysis aimed to explore the factors influencing the Armenian population's perceptions on four key topics: the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Armenia's main enemy, Armenia's main friend, and opinions about the European Union (EU), using data from the Caucasus Barometer 2019 survey.\n",
    "1. Perception of the Dissolution of the Soviet Union:\n",
    "\tContrary to our expectations, there was no significant correlation between respondents' political affiliations or income levels and their views on the dissolution of the Soviet Union. However, education and age played a significant role: respondents with higher education levels were more likely to view the dissolution positively, as were younger respondents, indicating a generational shift in perspectives.\n",
    "2. Perception of Armenia's Main Enemy:\n",
    "\tThe analysis showed that respondents who support EU integration were more likely to perceive Russia as Armenia's main enemy, while those who view Russia as an ally tended to see Azerbaijan as the primary enemy. Contrary to our expectations, political party affiliation did not significantly influence perceptions of Turkey as Armenia's main enemy, suggesting that Armenian political parties may not be effectively shaping public opinion on this issue. Additionally, education level did not significantly impact the perception of Russia as Armenia's main enemy.\n",
    "3. Perception of Armenia's Main Friend:\n",
    "\tThe perception of Russia as Armenia's main friend did not differ significantly between older and younger generations, counter to our initial assumptions as the older generation was inclined to believe that the resolution of the USSR was bad. This indicates to us that people have the wrong notion about the USSR and don't perceive it as a Russian communist empire. However this is a topic of further research. Respondents who identified Turkey or Azerbaijan as Armenia's main enemy were more likely to consider Russia a friend, highlighting the complex geopolitical dynamics at play.\n",
    "4. Opinion about the European Union (EU):\n",
    "\tSurprisingly, none of the hypothesized factors—age, education, or religiosity—significantly influenced respondents' opinions about the EU. This suggests that public opinion on the EU is less affected by demographic or socio-cultural factors than by other, perhaps more immediate, concerns. This will also require further research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our findings indicate that traditional predictors such as political affiliation and income levels have limited influence on certain perceptions within the Armenian population, particularly regarding the dissolution of the Soviet Union and views on the EU. In contrast, education and age were found to significantly influence opinions on the dissolution, reflecting broader societal shifts.\n",
    "To sum up, we want to note again that the data was collected in 2019, prior to the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War and the subsequent ethnic cleansing and mass migration of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh, events which have significantly impacted public opinion. Preliminary reports and limited surveys suggest a dramatic shift in perceptions. As a spoiler a significant portion of the population now view Russia as a major threat and France as Armenia's main ally. Comprehensive data from the latest Caucasus Barometer survey, expected next year, will provide data for 2024, and we plan to compare these findings to our current analysis to understand how recent events have reshaped Armenian public opinion.\n"
