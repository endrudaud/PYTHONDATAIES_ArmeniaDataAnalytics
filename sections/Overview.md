# Project Overview

In our project, we aimed to explore the factors influencing the perceptions of the Armenian population on four key topics:

- Whether the dissolution of the Soviet Union was perceived as a good or bad thing.
- Who is perceived as the main enemy of Armenia.
- Who is perceived as the main friend of Armenia.
- Opinions regarding the European Union (EU).

To investigate these topics, we analyzed data from the 2019 Caucasus Barometer, which conducts annual surveys on social and political matters in Armenia and Georgia. We chose the 2019 data as it provides insights from a pivotal period: one year before the 2020 war with Azerbaijan and one year after the Armenian revolution. This context allows us to assess public sentiment during a time of significant change in Armenia.

Our analysis focused on how various independent variables—such as respondents' age, income, education level, and political affiliation or sympathy towards liberal or conservative parties—influence these perceptions. For each of the four topics, we generated specific hypotheses that we aimed to test and potentially reject, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the social dynamics shaping public opinion in Armenia during this period.
